# Spline-Interactive-Gradient

# About the Project
This project is an interactive gradient experience created using Spline. It allows users to explore smooth color transitions dynamically, offering a visually engaging and immersive experience. The goal was to create an interactive digital artwork that responds to user input, showcasing the power of real-time rendering and motion in design.

# Who are the Users
This interactive gradient is designed for users who appreciate interactivity on a web-based experience.  It serves as a relaxing, meditative visual experience for users to influence the visual design, creating their own artwork.  This experience demonstrates color theory and digital interactivity to users.

# Process
The project was developed using Spline, a 3D design tool that enables real-time interactivity. The process involved:

- Experimenting with gradient color transitions, displacement, and movement applied to a sphere
- Adjusting lighting, shading, and perspective to enhance depth
- Implementing cursor-follwing interactivity to allow users to influence the visual experience
- Refining responsiveness and performance for smooth exploration
